## Thermochemistry

Thermochemistry: Quantification of the energy of chemical rxns and changes. It is a subset of thermodynamics.

Internal energy (U): energy contained in a system.

$\Delta U$ represents the **change** in energy, in other terms: $U_{f} - U_{i}$

**Terminology**:

* Universe -- Everything
* System -- The part of the universe that we are studying (we need to define it)

* Endothermic -- When heat **enters** the system. That is to say, the **change in energy** is _positive_, as the system gains energy.
* Exothermic -- When heat **exits** the system, into the surroundings. That is to say, the **change in energy** is _negative_, as the system loses energy.

## Types of Systems

* Open: Matter and energy are exchanged w/ surroundings
* Closed: Only energy is exchanged w/ surroundings
* Isolated: Nothing exchanged

## First Law of Thermo

$$
\Delta U = Q + W = Q - P \Delta V
$$

**Enthalpy**:

$$
\Delta H = q
$$

$q$ is a path function, $\Delta H$ is a state function

* Path functions depend on the path taken
* State functions don't depend on path (only depend on the initial and final states regardless of the pathway that took place)

## Changes in Enthalpy

- Due to temperature change
- Due to chemical rxn
- Due to phase changes
  - evaporation/boiling (system needs to absorb heat for phase change) or condensation (system needs to release heat for phase change)
