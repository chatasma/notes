Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):

"Algorithm":

```
Repeatedly // (n - 1) times
  pick the shortest edge connecting the visited point to an unvisited
  mark unvisited as unvisited // O(n^2)
```

This is a O(n^3) running time algorithm.

This is algorithm is correct, why?  Graph Theory. We can prove this later

More cleverly, we can solve this problem in O(n^2)
