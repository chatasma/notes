## What is queueing theory?

* Mathematical study of _wait queues_


## Geometric Distribution

$$
P(X = n) = (1 - p)^{n}
$$

Expected number of failures before success

$$
E(X) = \frac{1-p}{p}
$$

$$
\sigma^{2} (X) = \frac{1 - p}{p^{2}}
$$

## Poisson Distribution

$$
P(X = n) = \frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!} e^{- \lambda}
$$

Expected value is just going to be the rate, which is $\lambda$

$$
E(X) = \sigma^{2} (X) = \lambda
$$

## Exponential Distribution

$$
f(t; \mu ) = \mu e^{- \mu t}
$$

Where:

* $t$ is time
* $\mu$ is a rate

Probability of time $t$ elapsing between successive independent events

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

$$
\sigma^{2} (X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}
$$

$$
C_{x} = \text{coefficient of variance} = 1
$$
