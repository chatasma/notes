## What's a process

A program in execution

## Multitasking

* Modern OSes run dozens to hundreds of processes simultaneously
* Could exceed the hardware capacity

### CPU Memory Virtualization

* _Time-slicing_ of CPU(s) is done to simulate concurrency
* Memory is partitioned as well
* Per-process view is a _uniform address space_
* _Lazy/On-demand loading_ of processes lowers total burden

Contrast that to batch processing where jobs were done individually and synchronously. Cringe.

### Forms of Multitasking

* _Cooperative_ multitasking: processes voluntarily give control to the OS
* _Preemptive_ multitasking: OS policies transitions (how?)
* _Real-time_ systems: hard, fixed time constraints
