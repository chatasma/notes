## Queueing Theory

### Formulas

Little's Law:

$$
E(L) = \lambda E(T)
$$

Utilization:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$


Number of total customers $L$. This is only dependent on $\rho$.

$$
P(L = n) = p_{n} = ( 1 - \rho ) \rho^{n}
$$

Expected value of $T$

$$
E(T) = \frac{1}{\mu ( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} )} = \frac{1}{\mu ( 1 - \rho )} = \frac{1}{ \mu - \lambda }
$$

Expected value of $L$

$$
E(L) = \frac{ \lambda }{\mu ( 1 - \rho )} = \frac{\rho}{( 1 - \rho )}
$$

$$
E(T_{q}) \mu^{2} - E(L_{q}) \mu - \lambda = 0
$$


Relationship between expected value of time to service customer to service rate

$$
E(T_{s}) = \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

Relationship between expected value of time to service customer to service rate

$$
E(T_{q}) = E(T) - E(T_{s}) = \frac{ \rho }{ \mu (1 - \rho )}
$$
