## Formulas

Molar mass

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:molar_mass}
    M = m N_{A}
\end{equation}

Moles per mass sample

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:moles_per_mass_sample}
    n = \frac{N}{N_{A}} = \frac{M_{sam}}{M} = \frac{M_{sam}}{m N_{A}}
\end{equation}

Ideal Gas formula

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ideal_gas_law}
    pV = nRT
\end{equation}

Where:

* $p$ is the pressure of the gas
* $V$ is the volume of the gas
* $n$ is the number of moles of the gas
* $R$ is known as the gas constant ($8.31$ J/mol * k)
* $T$ is the temperature of the gas

The ideal gas law can also be represented with Boltzmann's constant $k$ if we replace the number of moles with the number of elementary units, $N$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ideal_gas_law_molecules}
    pV = NkT
\end{equation}

Where:

* $N$ is the number of elementary units
* $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K)

The work done when volume of an ideal gas changes (and temperature stays constant [isothermal])

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:isothermal_process_work}
    W = nRT ln ( \frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}} )
\end{equation}

Pressure exerted by $n$ moles of an ideal gas

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ideal_gas_pressure}
    p = \frac{n M v^{2}_{rms}}{3V}
\end{equation}

Where:

* $v_{rms} = \sqrt{(v^{2})_{avg}}$, this is the root-mean-squared speed of the gas molecules
* $M$ is the molar mass of the gas
* $V$ is the volume of the gas
* $n$ is the number of moles

RMS (root-mean-squared) speed expressed in terms of temperature and molar mass:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rms_terms_temperature}
    v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\end{equation}

Where:

* $T$ is the temperature of the gas
* $R$ is known as the gas constant ($8.31$ J/mol * k)
* $M$ is the molar mass of the gas

Average translational kinetic energy per molecule in an ideal gas:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:translational_kinetic_energy}
    K_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}_{rms}
\end{equation}

Average translational kinetic energy per molecule in an ideal gas _in terms of temperature_:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:translational_kinetic_energy_temperature}
    K_{avg} = \frac{3}{2} k T
\end{equation}

Where:

* $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K)

Mean free path of a molecule (average distance traveled between collisions of a molecule):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mean_free_path}
    \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^{2} N/V}
\end{equation}

Where:

* $d$ is the diameter of the molecule
* $N/V$ is the number of molecules per unit volume

Sometimes we are interested in the distribution of molecular speeds. The Maxwell speed distribution allows us to do this. It is a function $P(v)$ such that $P(v) dv$ is a fraction of molecules with speeds in the interval $dv$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:maxwell_speed_distribution}
    P(v) = 4 \pi ( \frac{M}{2 \pi RT} )^{\frac{3}{2}} v^{2} e^{\frac{-M v^{2}}{2RT}}
\end{equation}

Based on this distribution, we can find a few speeds of interest relative to the distribution:

The average speed of the distribution is given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:avg_speed_maxwell_dist}
    v_{avg} = \frac{8RT}{\pi M}
\end{equation}

The most probable speed of the distribution is given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:probable_speed_maxwell_dist}
    v_{p} = \frac{2RT}{M}
\end{equation}

The RMS speed of the distribution is given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rms_speed_maxwell_dist}
    v_{rms} = \frac{3RT}{M}
\end{equation}

Where:

* $R$ is known as the gas constant ($8.31$ J/mol * k)
* $M$ is the molar mass

The molar specific heat $C_{v}$ of a gas at constant volume:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:molar_specific_heat}
    C_{v} = \frac{Q}{n \Delta T} = \frac{\Delta E_{int}}{n \Delta T}
\end{equation}

For an ideal monatomic gas:

$$
C_{v} = \frac{3}{2} R = 12.5\text{J/mol * k}
$$

Molar specific heat from constant volume to constant pressure

$$
C_{p} = C_{v} + R
$$

Change in internal energy due to temp change of an ideal gas:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:work_ideal_gas_deltatemp}
    \Delta E_{int} = n C_{v} \Delta T
\end{equation}

Where:

* $Q$ is the energy transferred as heat to or from a sample of $n$ moles.
* $\Delta T$ is the resulting temperature change from the energy transfer

Molar specific heat based on degrees of freedom:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:molar_specific_heat_dof}
    C_{v} = ( \frac{f}{2} ) R
\end{equation}

Notes:

* For monatomic gases, degrees of freedom is 3 and for diatomic gases it is 5.

If an ideal gas goes through a slow adiabatic volume change (such that $Q = 0$), $p V^{\gamma}$ is a constant. Note: $\gamma = \frac{C_{p}}{C_{v}}$ -- this is the ratio of molar specific heats for the gas.

For free expansion, $pV$ is a constant.

## Avogadro's Number

The kinetic theory of gases relates the macroscopic properties of a gas, like its pressure/temperature, to properties of the molecules that make it up.

We say that a **mole** of a substance contains $N_{A}$ elementary units (atoms/molecules). $N_{A}$ experimentally is $6.02 \times 10^{23}\ mol^{-1}$. A molar mass $M$ of a substance is the mass of 1 mole of the substance.

Molar mass is represented by formula \ref{eq:molar_mass}

## Ideal Gases

The pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are related by formula \ref{eq:ideal_gas_law} if the gas is an ideal gas.

The work done by a gas when its volume changes (and its temperature is constant) is given by formula \ref{eq:isothermal_process_work}.

## Pressure, Temperature, and RMS speed

The pressure an ideal gas exerts is given by \ref{eq:ideal_gas_pressure}

The RMS speed in terms of temperature and molar mass is given by \ref{eq:rms_terms_temperature}

## Translational Kinetic Energy

Molecules move around, so they have kinetic energy. The average translational kinetic energy per molecule in an ideal gas is given by \ref{eq:translational_kinetic_energy}.
