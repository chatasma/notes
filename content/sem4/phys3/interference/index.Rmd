## Formulas

_Light as a wave_

Index of refraction of a medium can be found by:

$$
n = \frac{c}{v}
$$

Where:

* $n$ is the index of refraction
* $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum
* $v$ is the speed of light in the medium

The wavelength of light in a medium depends on the index of refraction $n$ of the medium:

$$
\lambda_{n} = \frac{\lambda}{n}
$$

Where:

* $\lambda$ is the wavelength in vacuum

Since wavelength depends on index of refraction, phase difference can change due to medium.

_Young's Interference Experiment_

To find the maximum intensity of an interference for Young's experiment:

$$
d = sin \theta = m \lambda
$$

Minimum intensity:

$$
d = sin \theta = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda
$$

Where:

* $m$ is 0, 1, 2...
* $d$ is the slit separation
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength$

In Young's interference experiment, two waves of intensity $I_{0}$ will yield a resulting wave of intensity $I$ at the viewing screen:

$$
I = 4 I_{0} cos^{2} \frac{1}{2} \phi
$$

Where:

* $\phi = \frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda} sin \theta$

Maxima for light incident on a thin transparent film (bright film in air):

$$
2L = (m + \frac{1}{2} ) \frac{\lambda}{n_{2}}
$$

Minima (dark film in air):

$$
2L = m \frac{\lambda}{n_{2}}
$$

Where:

* $n_{2}$ is the index of refreaction of the film
* $L$ is the thickness of the film
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in air

Phase difference of recombining beams (Michelson's Interferometer):

$$
\text{phase difference} = \frac{2L}{\lambda} (n - 1)
$$

Where:

* $n$ is the index of refraction of the transparent material
* $L$ is the thickness of one path
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light
