## Cool Values

$ch = 1240 \text{eV nm}$

## Formulas

For light of frequency $f$ and wavelength $\lambda$, the photon energy is:

$$
E = hf
$$

Where:

* $h$ is Planck's constant

### The Photoelectric Effect

When light of high enough frequency illuminates a metal surface, the electrons of the metal surface can gain energy to escape the metal by absorbing the photons of the light. That's called the photoelectric effect.

The conservation of energy of such an absorption and escape is written as:

$$
hf = K_{max} + \Phi
$$

Where:

* $hf$ represents the energy of the absorbed photon
* $K_{max}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons of the metal that are escaping
* $\Phi$ is the least amount of energy needed to escape the electric forces that keep the electrons in the metal
  * If $hf = \Phi$, then the electrons can barely escape (minimum threshold is met)
  * If $hf < \Phi$, then the electrons cannot escape

## Photons and Momentum

Momentum of a photon

$$
p = \frac{hf}{c} = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$

Wavelength increase due to Compton shift (where split x-rays lose energy to electrons of a target they hit)

$$
\Delta lambda = \frac{h}{mc} ( 1 - cos \phi )
$$

Where:

* $m$ is the mass of the target electron
* $\phi$ is the angle at which the photon is scattered from its initial travel direction

## Quantum Physics

Spectral radiancy

$$
S( \lambda ) = \frac{\text{intensity}}{\text{(unit wavelength)}}
$$

Planck radiation law:

$$
S( \lambda ) = \frac{2 \pi c^{2} h}{\lambda^{5}} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}} - 1}
$$

Where:

* $h$ is the Planck constant
* $k$ is the Boltzmann constant
* $T$ is the temeprature of the radiating surface (Kelvin)

Wien's law. Relates the temperature $T$ of a blackbody radiator and the wavelength $\lambda_{max}$ at which the spectral radiancy is maximum.

$$
\lambda_{max} T = 2898 \mu m * K
$$

## Electrons and Matter Waves

A moving particle such as an electron can be described as a matter wave. The wavelength associated with the matter wave is the particle's de Broglie wavelength:

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$

Where:

* $p$ is the particle's momentum

## Schrodinger's Equation

$$
\frac{d^{2} \psi}{dx^{2}} + k^{2} \psi = 0
$$

Where:

* $k$ is the angular wave number

$k$ is related to $\lambda$, which is the de Broglie wavelength, and the momentum $p$, and the kinetic energy $E - U$ by:

$$
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} = \frac{2 \pi p}{h} = \frac{2 \pi \sqrt{2m (E - U)}}{h}
$$

A particle does not have a specific location until its location is actually measured

The probability of detecting a particle in a small volume cented on a given point is proportional to the probability density $\lvert \psi \rvert^{2}$ of the matter wave at that point.

## Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle

$$
\Delta x * \Delta p_{x} \geq h
$$

$$
\Delta y * \Delta p_{y} \geq h
$$

$$
\Delta z * \Delta p_{z} \geq h
$$

## Reflection from a Potential Step

$R$ is the average fraction of a beam with alot of particles that will undergo reflection

Transmission coefficient

$$
T = 1 - R
$$

## Tunneling through a Potential Barrier

Transmission coefficient:

$$
T \approx e^{-e b L}
$$

Where $b$ is:

$$
b = \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi^{2} m ( U_{b} - E )}{h^{2}}}
$$

## Problems

## Problem 3

This question is regarding **the photon**.

> At what rate does the Sun emit photons? For simplicity, assume that the Sun's entire emission at the rate of $3.9 \times 10^{26}$ W is at the single wavelength of 550 nm.

We know:

$$
P = R E
$$

We have the power, and we need to find R (photons / s).

$$
R = \frac{P}{E}
$$

$$
R = \frac{P}{\frac{hc}{\lambda}}
$$

$$
R = \frac{P}{\frac{hc}{\lambda}}
$$

I choose to stick to electron volts for this as I know $hc = 1240$ eV nm and we are using nanometers.

$$
R = \frac{3.9 \times 10^{26}}{\frac{1240}{550}} * 6.24 \times 10^{18}
$$

Our answer comes out to be $1.0 \times 10^{45}$ photons/s, our answer.

## Problem 7

This question is regarding **the photon**.

> A light detector (your eye) has an area of $2.00 \times 10^{-6}$ $m^{2}$ and absorbs 80% of the incident light, which is at wavelength 500 nm. The detector faces an isotropic source, 3.00 m from the source. If the detector absorbs photons at the rate of exactly 4.000 $s^{-1}$, at what power does the emitter emit light?

First, find the rate at which photons are being emitted from the light source:

$$
R_{detector} = (0.80) * \frac{A_{eye}}{4 \pi r^{2}} R_{source}
$$

Find $R_{source}$

$$
R_{source} = \frac{4 \pi (3.00)^{2}}{(0.80) * 2 \times 10^{-6}} * 4
$$

$R_{source}$ comes out to be $2.83 \times 10^{8}$.

Next, find the energy of each photon. Once we do this, we know how much energy is contained per photon (energy/photon) and we have the rate at which photons are emitted (photons/s) so we can find the power (energy/s):

$$
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240}{540}
$$

This comes out to be 2.48

Finally:

$$
P = RE = (2.83 \times 10^{8}) * (2.48)
$$

This comes out to be $1.1 \times 10^{-10}$ W, our answer.

## Problem 18

This question is regarding **the photoelectric effect**.

> You wish to pick an element for a photocell that will operate via the photoelectric effect with visible light. Which of the following are suitable (work functions are in parentheses): tantalum (4.2 eV), tungsten (4.5 eV), aluminum (4.2 eV), barium (2.5 eV), lithium (2.3 eV)?

First, find the maximum energy that visible light can provide us with:

$$
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

$$
E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} * (3 \times 10^{8})}{400}
$$

We choose 400 here (lower bound of the range for visible light) to maximize the energy, so we have a better opportunity to satisfy the work function. We get $3.1$ eV as the energy of the absorbed photon.

Thus, we would choose **barium and lithium** as our materials, since the maximum energy exceeds these work functions.

## Problem 31

> What percentage increase in wavelength leads to a 75% loss of photon energy in a photon-free electron collision?

We know:

$$
E - E' = E - 0.25 E
$$

$$
E - 0.25 E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \frac{hc}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

$$
0.75 E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \frac{hc}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

$$
\frac{0.75 E}{h} = \frac{c}{\lambda} - \frac{c}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

We know $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

$$
\frac{0.75c}{\lambda} = \frac{c}{\lambda} - \frac{c}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

$$
0.75 = 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

$$
0.25 = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda^{'}}
$$

$$
\lambda^{'} = 4 \lambda
$$

So:

$$
\lambda^{'} - \lambda = 4 \lambda - \lambda = 3 \lambda
$$

Thus, a **300%** increase leads to a 75% loss of photon energy in a photon-free electron collision.

## Problem 43

> Just after detonation, the fireball in a nuclear blast is approximately an ideal blackbody radiator with a surface temperature of about $1.0 \times 10^{7}$ K.
> 
> * Find the wavelength at which the thermal radiation is maximum
> * Identify the type of electromagnetic wave corresponding to that wavelength. (See Fig. 33-1.)
> * This radiation is almost immediately absorbed by the surrounding air molecules, which produces another ideal blackbody radiator with a surface temperature of about $1.0 \times 10^{5}$ K. Find the wavelength at which the thermal radiation is maximum.
> * Identify the type of electromagnetic wave corresponding to that wavelength.

For this question, we use Wien's Law:

$$
\lambda_{max} T = 2898 \mu m
$$

Solve for $\lambda_{max}$ for part a:

$$
\lambda_{max} = \frac{2898}{1 \times 10^{7}}
$$

This comes out to be $2.9 \times 10^{-10}$ m, our answer.

From the electromagnetic wave spectrum we see that **x-rays** correspond to this wavelength.

For part c and d, we repeat the procedure using a different value for the temperature:

$$
\lambda_{max} = \frac{2898}{1 \times 10^{5}}
$$

This comes out to be $2.9 \times 10^{-8}$ m, our answer.

From the electromagnetic wave spectrum we see that **ultraviolet waves** correspond to this wavelength.
