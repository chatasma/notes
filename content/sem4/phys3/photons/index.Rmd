## Formulas

For light of frequency $f$ and wavelength $\lambda$, the photon energy is:

$$
E = hf
$$

Where:

* $h$ is Planck's constant

### The Photoelectric Effect

When light of high enough frequency illuminates a metal surface, the electrons of the metal surface can gain energy to escape the metal by absorbing the photons of the light. That's called the photoelectric effect.

The conservation of energy of such an absorption and escape is written as:

$$
hf = K_{max} + \Phi
$$

Where:

* $hf$ represents the energy of the absorbed photon
* $K_{max}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons of the metal that are escaping
* $\Phi$ is the least amount of energy needed to escape the electric forces that keep the electrons in the metal
  * If $hf = \Phi$, then the electrons can barely escape (minimum threshold is met)
  * If $hf < \Phi$, then the electrons cannot escape

## Photons and Momentum

Momentum of a photon

$$
p = \frac{hf}{c} = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$

Wavelength increase due to Compton shift (where split x-rays lose energy to electrons of a target they hit)

$$
\Delta lambda = \frac{h}{mc} ( 1 - cos \phi )
$$

Where:

* $m$ is the mass of the target electron
* $\phi$ is the angle at which the photon is scattered from its initial travel direction

## Quantum Physics

Spectral radiancy

$$
S( \lambda ) = \frac{\text{intensity}}{\text{(unit wavelength)}}
$$

Planck radiation law:

$$
S( \lambda ) = \frac{2 \pi c^{2} h}{\lambda^{5}} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}} - 1}
$$

Where:

* $h$ is the Planck constant
* $k$ is the Boltzmann constant
* $T$ is the temeprature of the radiating surface (Kelvin)

Wien's law. Relates the temperature $T$ of a blackbody radiator and the wavelength $\lambda_{max}$ at which the spectral radiancy is maximum.

$$
\lambda_{max} T = 2898 \mu m * K
$$

## Electrons and Matter Waves

A moving particle such as an electron can be described as a matter wave. The wavelength associated with the matter wave is the particle's de Broglie wavelength:

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$

Where:

* $p$ is the particle's momentum

## Schrodinger's Equation

$$
\frac{d^{2} \psi}{dx^{2}} + k^{2} \psi = 0
$$

Where:

* $k$ is the angular wave number

$k$ is related to $\lambda$, which is the de Broglie wavelength, and the momentum $p$, and the kinetic energy $E - U$ by:

$$
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} = \frac{2 \pi p}{h} = \frac{2 \pi \sqrt{2m (E - U)}}{h}
$$

A particle does not have a specific location until its location is actually measured

The probability of detecting a particle in a small volume cented on a given point is proportional to the probability density $\lvert \psi \rvert^{2}$ of the matter wave at that point.

## Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle

$$
\Delta x * \Delta p_{x} \geq h
$$

$$
\Delta y * \Delta p_{y} \geq h
$$

$$
\Delta z * \Delta p_{z} \geq h
$$

## Reflection from a Potential Step

$R$ is the average fraction of a beam with alot of particles that will undergo reflection

Transmission coefficient

$$
T = 1 - R
$$

## Tunneling through a Potential Barrier

Transmission coefficient:

$$
T \approx e^{-e b L}
$$

Where $b$ is:

$$
b = \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi^{2} m ( U_{b} - E )}{h^{2}}}
$$
