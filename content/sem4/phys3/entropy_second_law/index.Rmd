## Formulas

Entropy change $\Delta S$ for a reversible process that takes a system between the initial to final (or vice versa) state:

$$
\Delta S = S_{f} - S_{i} = \int_{i}^{f} \frac{dQ}{T}
$$

Where:

* $Q$ is the energy transferred as heat to or from the system during the process
* $T$ is the temperature of the system in kelvins during the process

For a reversible isothermal process:

$$
\Delta S = S_{f} - S_{i} = \frac{Q}{T}
$$

When the temperature change $\Delta T$ of a system is small relative to the temperature (in Kelvins) before and after the process, the entropy change can be approximated as:

$$
\Delta S = S_{f} - S_{i} \approx \frac{Q}{T_{avg}}
$$

Where:

* $T_{avg}$ is the system's average temperature during the process.

When an ideal gas (reversibly) changes from an initial state, with changes to temp and volume, the change in entropy of the gas is:

$$
\Delta S = S_{f} - S_{i} = nR ln \frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}} = n C_{v} ln \frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}
$$

The second law of thermo is an extension of the entropy postulate: it states that if a process occurs in a closed system, the entropy of the system **increases for irreversible processes** and **remains constant for reversible processes**. Entropy of the system will **never decrease**. Meaning:

$$
\Delta S \geq 0
$$

Efficiency $\varepsilon$ of an engine:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\text{energy we get}}{\text{energy we pay for}} = \frac{\lvert W \rvert}{\lvert Q_{H} \rvert}
$$

Carnot engine efficiency

$$
\varepsilon_{C} = 1 - \frac{\lvert Q_{L} \rvert}{\lvert Q_{H} \rvert} = 1 = \frac{T_{L}}{T_{H}}
$$

Where:

* $T_{H}$ is the temperature of the high-temperature reservoir
* $T_{L}$ is the temperature of the low-temperature reservoir

Notes:

* Real Carnot engines always have an efficient lower than that of a Carnot engines. Even ideal engines that are not Carnot engines also have efficiencies that are lower than a Carnot engine
* A perfect engine is where we extract heat from a hot reservoir and convert it straight into work. Though, an engine like this would violate the second law of thermodynamics.

Coefficient of performance $K$ for a refrigerator:

$$
K = \frac{\text{what we want}}{\text{what we pay for}} = \frac{\lvert Q_{L} \rvert}{\lvert W \rvert}
$$

A Carnot refrigerator is a Carnot engine in reverse:

$$
K_{C} = \frac{\lvert Q_{L} \rvert}{\lvert Q_{H} \rvert - \lvert Q_{L} \rvert} = \frac{T_{L}}{T_{H} - T_{L}}
$$

The perfect refrigerator is when the energy extracted (as heat) from the low-temp reservoir is converted completely to heat _discharged_ to the high-temperature reservoir without the need to do any work. This would violate the second law of thermodynamics though.

For a system of $N$ molecules, that may be distributed between two halves of a box, the multiplicity is given by:

$$
W = \frac{N!}{n_{1}! n_{2}!}
$$

Where:

* $n_{1}$ is the number of molecules in one half of the box
* $n_{2}$ is the number of molecules in the other half

Multiplicity $W$ of a configuration fo a system and the entropy $S$ of the system in that configuration are related by Boltzmann's entropy equation:

$$
S = k ln W
$$

Where:

* $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\text{ J/K}$ -- this is the Boltzmann constant

When $N$ is very large (the usual case), we can approximate $ln N!$ with Stirling's approximation:

$$
ln N! \approx N(ln N) - N
$$
