## Formulas

Minima for diffraction of single slit:

$$
a sin \theta = m \lambda
$$

Where:

* $m$ = 1, 2, 3...
* $\lambda$ is wavelength
* $\theta$ is the separation angle
* $a$ is the slit width

Intensity of the diffraction pattern for single slit diffraction for an angle $\theta$ is:

$$
I( \theta ) = I_{m} ( \frac{ sin \alpha }{ \alpha } )^{2}
$$

Where:

* $I_{m}$ is the intensity at the center of the pattern
* $$
\alpha = \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} sin \theta
$$

Rayleigh's criterion:

$$
\theta_{R} = 1.22 \frac{ \lambda }{d}
$$

Where:

* $d$ is the diameter of the aperture through which the light passes.

Notes:

* Suggests two objects are on the verge of resolvability if the central diffraction maximum of one is at the first minimum of the other


For identical slits (double slits in this case) with width $a$ and center-to-center separation $d$, the intensity in the pattern varies with the angle $\theta$ from the central axis as:

$$
I( \theta ) = I_{m} ( cos^{2} \beta ) (\frac{sin \alpha}{ \alpha })^{2}
$$

Where:

* $I_{m}$ is the intensity at the center of the pattern
* $$
  \beta = ( \frac{\pi d}{\lambda} ) sin \theta
$$
* $$
  \alpha = ( \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} ) sin \theta
$$

Diffraction by multiple slits ($N$) results in maxima (lines) at angles $\theta$ such that

$$
d sin \theta = m \lambda
$$

Where:

* $m$ = 0, 1, 2, ...

A line's half-width is the angle from its center to the point where it disappears into the darkness and is given by:

$$
\Delta \theta_{hw} = \frac{ \lambda }{ N d cos \theta }
$$

Dispersion $D$ of a diffraction grating:

$$
D = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta \lambda} = \frac{m}{d cos \theta}
$$

Notes:

* Dispersion of a diffraction grating is the measure of the angular separation $\Delta \theta$ of the lines it produces for two wavelengths differing by $\lambda$.
* $m$ is the order number
* $\theta$ is the angle

Resolving power $R$ of a diffraction grating is a measure of its ability to make the emission lines of two close wavelengths distinguishable. For two wavelengths differing by $\Delta \lambda$ and with an average value of $\lambda_{avg}$, the resolving power is given by:

$$
R = \frac{\lambda_{avg}}{\Delta \lambda} = N m
$$

For x rays of wavelength $\lambda$ scattering from crystal planes with separation $d$, the angles $\theta$ at which the scattered intensity is maximum are given by:

$$
2 d sin \theta = m \lambda
$$

## Problems

## Problem 5

This problem is regarding **single-slit diffraction**.

> A single slit is illuminated by light of wavelengths $\lambda_{a}$ and $\lambda_{b}$, chosen so that the first diffraction minimum of the $\lambda_{a}$ component coincides with the second minimum of the $\lambda_{b}$ component.
> 
> * If $\lambda_{b}$ = 350 nm, what is $\lambda_{a}$?
> * For what order number $m_{b}$ (if any) does a minimum of the $\lambda_{b}$ component coincide with the minimum of the $\lambda_{a}$ component in the order number:
>   * $m_{a}$ = 2
>   * $m_{a}$ = 3

We know that

$$
a sin \theta = m \lambda
$$

Since the first order diffraction minimum $m = 1$ of $\lambda_{a}$ coincides with the second order diffraction minimum $m = 2$ of $\lambda_{b}$, we can simply set them equal to each other:

$$
2 * \lambda_{b} = 1 * \lambda_{a}
$$

$$
\lambda_{a} = 2 * \lambda_{b}
$$

$$
\lambda_{a} = 2 * 350
$$

Thus, our answer for part a is $700$ nm.

For b and c, we can simply multiply constants to this:

$$
\lambda_{a} = 2 * \lambda_{b}
$$

$$
2 * \lambda_{a} = 2 * 2 * \lambda_{b}
$$

Thus, our answer is $4$ for part b.

$$
3 * \lambda_{a} = 3 * 2 * \lambda_{b}
$$

Thus, our answer is $6$ for part c.

## Problem 15

This problem is regarding **intensity in single-slit diffraction**.

> See book for question

Part A:

$$
I( \theta ) = I_{m} * ( \frac{ sin \alpha }{ \alpha } )^{2}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2} = ( \frac{ sin \alpha }{ \alpha } )^{2}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2} = ( \frac{ sin^{2} \alpha }{ \alpha^{2} } )
$$

$$
\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2} = sin^{2} \alpha
$$

Part B:

$$
\frac{1.39^{2}}{2} = sin^{2} ( 1.39 )
$$

This indeed holds true so 1.39 radians is a solution

Part C:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} sin \theta
$$

$$
\theta = sin^{-1} \frac{\lambda \alpha}{\pi a}
$$

$$
\theta = sin^{-1} \frac{0.442 \lambda}{a}
$$

Note:

$$
\Delta \theta = 2 \theta
$$

So:

$$
\Delta \theta = 2 sin^{-1} \frac{0.442 \lambda}{a}
$$

Part D:

$$
2 sin^{-1} \frac{0.442}{1}
$$

Thus, our answer is $52.5^{\circ}$

Part E:

$$
2 sin^{-1} \frac{0.442}{5}
$$

Thus, our answer is $10.1^{\circ}$

Part F:

$$
2 sin^{-1} \frac{0.442}{10}
$$

Thus, our answer is $5.06^{\circ}$

## Problem 23

This problem is regarding **diffraction by a circular aperture**.

> The two headlights of an approaching automobile are 1.4 m apart. At what 
> 
> * angular separation and maximum distance will the eye resolve them?
> 
> Assume that the pupil diameter is 5.0 mm, and use a wavelength of 550 nm for the light. Also assume that diffraction effects alone limit the resolution so that Rayleigh's criterion can be applied.

Apply Rayleigh's criterion:

$$
\theta_{R} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}
$$

$$
\theta_{R} = 1.22 \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{5.0 \times 10^{-3}}
$$

Thus, $\theta_{R} = 1.3 \times 10^{-4}\text{ radians}$, our answer

$sin$ is the ratio of separation to the maximum distance, so we can use this to solve for the distance:

$$
\frac{d_{h}}{L} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}
$$

$$
L = \frac{d_{h}}{1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}}
$$


We know $d_{h}$ and we just calculated the angle, so we can solve for $L$. $L$ comes out to be 10432.19m, our answer.
