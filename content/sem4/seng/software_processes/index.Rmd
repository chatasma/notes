## What is a Software Process?

* A structured set of activities required to develop a software system, such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc. and the ordering of these activities.
* Process descriptions may include
  * **Products**, which are the outcomes of a process activity;
  * **Roles**, which reflect the responsibilities of the people invovled in the process.
  * **Pre- and post-conditions**, statements that are true before and after (respectively) a process activity has been enacted or a product produced.

## Software Process Models

* The waterfall model
  * Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
* Incremental development
  * Specification, development, and validation are **interleaved**. May be plan-driven or agile.
* Integration and configuration
  * The system is assembled from existing configurable components. May be plan-driven or agile.

In practice, most large systems are developed using a process that incorporates elements across these models

See slides for detailed benefits/problems between these 3 process models.

## Software Specification

* The process of establishing what services are required, and what the constraints are on the system's operation and development.
* Requirements engineering process
  * What do the system stakeholders require/expect from the system?
  * Requirements Specification -- defining the requirements in detail
  * Requirements validation -- checking the validity of the requirements
