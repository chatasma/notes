* Sample space and events
  * **Set**: Collection of distinct objects
    * Examples:
      * NBA teams: `{ Balls, Lakers }`
      * Fruits: `{ Kiwi, Watermelons, Orange}`
    * **Subset**:
      * Let A and B be two sets.
      * Every element of A is an element of B, then A is a subset of B ($A \subseteq B$)
      * If B does NOT contain additional elements, then A and B are equal
      * However, if B did contain additional elements, then A is a **proper subset** of B ($A \subset B$), because it is not equal to B and is a subset. A subset can include itself, a proper subset cannot.
  * **Experiment**: A process that generates a set of data
  * **Sample Space**: A set of all possible _outcomes_ of a statistical experiment
    * For example, for flipping a coin the *sample space* is `S = {H, T}`
    * Consider flipping two coins, our *sample space* would be `S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}`
    * Another example, tossing two die. The size of the sample space is $6^{2} = 36$
      * `S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (6, 6)}`
  * **Event**: A subset of *sample space* ($E \subseteq S$)
    * Considering the dice example, if the sum of the dice were 7:
      * `E = {(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)}`
  * 01/26/2021
  * **Union**: Consider two events, `E` and `F`. The union is denoted by $E \cup F$. It is defined to consist of all outcomes that are either in E _or_ F _or_ in both E and F.
    * Example: The sample space of flipping two coins.
      * `S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}`
      * `E = {HH, HT}`
      * `F = {TH}`
      * Then $E \cup F = \{HH, HT, TH\}$
  * **Intersection**: Consider two events, `E` and `F`. The intersection is denoted by $E \cap F$. It is defined to consist of all outcomes that are _common_ to E and F.
    * Example: The sample space of flipping two coins. Consider the same sample space from the union example .
      * Intersection: $E \cap F = \varnothing$
    * Example:
      * `E = {HH, HT, TH}`
      * `F = {HT, TH, TT}`
      * Intersection: $E \cap F = \{HT, TH\}$
    * We say, when $E \cap F = \varnothing$, that E and F are **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint**.
  * **Complement** of E with respect to S is the subset of all elements of S that are not in E, denoted by $E^{'}$
    * Example:
      * `S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}`
      * `E = {HH, HT, TH}`
      * $E^{'} = \{TT\}$
      * `F = {HT, TH, TT}`
      * $F^{'} = \{HH\}$
    * $E$ and $E^{'}$ are mutually exclusive, meaning $E \cap E^{'} = \varnothing$
    * $S^{'} = \varnothing$: Recall $S$ was the set being complemented with respect to, so its complement is just $S \cap S^{'} = \varnothing$

## Venn Diagrams

* **Commutative Laws**: These apply to binary operators like intersection and union.
* **Association Laws**: Also apply to intersection and union.
  * $( E \cup F ) \cup G = E \cup ( F \cup G )$
  * $( E \cap F ) \cap G = E \cap ( F \cap G )$
* **Distributive Laws**
  * $( E \cup F ) \cap G = (E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G)$
  * $( E \cap F ) \cup G = (E \cup G) \cap (F \cup G)$

* **DeMorgan's Laws**:


$$
( \cup_{i=1}^{n} E_{i} )^{'} = \cap_{i=1}^{n} E_{i}^{'}
$$

$$
( \cup_{i=1}^{n} E_{i} )^{'} = \cap_{i=1}^{n} E_{i}^{'}
$$

* Like `!(false or false)` is equivalent to `(not true and not true)`
* I will not eat (ice cream or pizza) = I will (not eat ice cream) and I will (not eat pizza).

Practice: Consider tossing two dice. Let S denote the sample space.

* A: The number on the second die is even
* B: The sum of the two numbers is even
* C: At least one number in the pair is odd

Then:

* $C^{'}$ would be that both numbers are even
* $A \cap B$ would be that both numbers are even
* $A \cap B^{'}$ would be that the second die is even, the first die is odd
* $A^{'} \cup B$ would be the sample space that has:
  * All possibilities where the first and second dice are even (B)
  * All possibilities where the first and second dice are odd (B)
  * All possibilities where the first die is even and second die is odd. ($A^{'}$)
  * Succintly put, (the number on the second die is odd) or (the sum is even).
* $A^{'} \cap C$ would be where the first die can be whatever, but the second die has to be odd. $A^{'}$ would actually be a proper subset of C, so this just evaluates to $A^{'}$

## Probability of an Event

`S = {a, b, c, d}`

Axioms: E is an event of a sample space S.

* $O \leq P(E) \leq 1$
* $P(S) = 1$
* A is a sequence of **mutually exclusive** events: $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, ..., $E_{n}$
  * $E_{i} \cap E_{j} = \varnothing$ when $i \neq j$

**Partition**: A collection of events {$E_{1}$, $E_{1}$, ..., $E_{1}$} of a sample space S.

If $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, ..., $E_{n}$ are mutually exclusive and the union of all the events is equal to S... then:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(E_{i}) = 1
$$

## Counting Principles

**The Multiplication Rule**

Rule: An experiment consists of $k$ steps, where:

* The first step has $n_{1}$ possible outcomes
* The second step has $n_{2}$ possible outcomes

...

* The $k$th step has $n_{k}$ possible outcomes

So, the total number of experimental outcomes is given by $n_{1} * n_{2} * ... * n_{k}$

Example: Tossing a pair of dice

* Find the number of sample points in the sample space
  * $6 * 6 = 36$
* Find the probability that the sum of the two dice is 8
  * `8 = {(2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)}`, so $P(E) = \frac{5}{36}$

## Permutations

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:permutation_def}
    \text{nPr} = \frac{n!}{(n - r!)}
\end{equation}

Where:

* $n$ is the number of total objects
* $r$ is the number of objects chosen

Notes:

* $4 \text{nPr} 4 = 4!$, makes sense because order matters in permutation.

Tips for permutation problems:

* Whether the objects are distinguishable or not
* Divide the solution into steps
* When the number is large, try with a smaller one


Example:

> There are five people, A, B, C, D, and E. You want to line them up but A and B has to stay together. How many possible ways can we arrange these five people?

First, we should view A and B as a single unit. This makes the problem considerably easier. From here, we can determine that we want to arrange 4 units with respect to order out of 4 total units. This is permute 4 4 (4 nPr 4). $4 nPr 4 = 4!$. Notice, though, that the A and B unit can take two forms (formally $2!$): AB or BA. To solve this, we just multiply our result by two -- this is because while the unit can take two forms, it is still one unit in any given sample point. So our answer is $2 * 4! = 48$.


If we had $n$ objects and divided them into $k$ groups. Suppose each $k$ group was non-distingushable, and each group has a size of $n_{1} ... n_{k}$. the multinomial theorem tells us the amount of permutations of the $n$ objects:

$$
\frac{n!}{n_{1}!n_{2}! ... n_{k}!}
$$

The following example should hopefully clear up what this implies.

### Example

> How many different letter arrangements are in the word KITTY?

Well, there are 5 letters, but there are two Ts. These two Ts are non distinguishable as a group. This means, when they appear together, there are technically two ways to arrange their order, however, it is only apparent as one (TT is TT no matter how you place the Ts). This means we have to exclude it using the division rule.

$$
\frac{5!}{2!} = 60
$$

Or more generally, we can use the multinomial theorem shown above, which I think is easier. A group of 1 letter is technically nondistiguishable, so we have these nondistinguishable groups:

* K
* I
* TT
* Y

Those are 4 groups, out of a total of 5 objects (letters). Applying the multinomial theorem, we have:

$$
\frac{5!}{1!1!2!1!} = 60
$$

## Combinations

Combinations are like permutations, but the order does not matter. The formula below then makes sense, because it divides out the repeats:

$$
\frac{n!}{(n-r)! r!}
$$

## Counting Principles Overview

* Multiplication rule works with replacement, permutations and combinations work without replacement.

## Example

The U.S. Senate consists of 100 senators, 2 from each of the 50 states. A committee consisting of 5 senators is to be formed:

* How many different committees are possible?
* How many are possible if no state can have more than 1 senator on the committee?

For the first part of the question, we do $\Comb{100}{5} = 75287520$.

For the second part of the question, let us say we are choosing 5 states out of 50 states. Then, for any state, we can have two senators. This is $2^{5}$ added possibilities, so we do $\Comb{50}{5} * 2^{5} = 67800320$.


## Example

A company orders supplies from 5 distributors and wishes to place 10 orders in a manner that allows every distributor **an equal chance** of obtaining any one order and there is no restriction on the number of orders that can be placed with a distributor. Find the probability that a particular distributor gets exactly 3 orders. 

First, we should find the sample size:

$5^{10}$ is our sample size. We can find this from the multiplication rule -- we repeatedly choose a distributor for each order _with replacement_. To elaborate, we choose a distributor, put them back, and then choose again until we have chosen 10 distributors for the 10 orders.

Now, we perform a series of steps:

Step 1: A particular distributor gets exactly 3 orders.

If there are 10 orders, we can choose 3 out of the 10 orders: $\Comb{10}{3} = 120$.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining 7 orders to the 4 remaining distributors

An order can go to any of the 4 distributors. We choose a distributor for the first order, but then put them back (with replacement), so we use multiplication rule to tackle this: $4^{7} = 16384$.

Finally, by the multiplication rule we can multiply these two steps to get the number of sample points that satisfy the condition:

$$
120 * 16384 = 1966080
$$

And, we can find the probability since we know the sample size:

$$
P(a) = \frac{n}{N} = \frac{120}{1966080} = 0.201
$$

## Example

Suppose you have six different types of flowers and three planters. In how many ways can you put three flowers in the first planter, two flowers in the second planter, and one flower in the final planter?

Well, first we choose 3 out of 6, then 2 out of 3, and then 1 out of 1:

$$
\Comb{6}{3} * \Comb{3}{2} * \Comb{1}{1} = 60
$$

## Example

Consider there are 3 yellow, 2 green, 4 red, 1 purple, and 5 orange skittles.

How many distinguishable arrangements are there?

For this question, we use the multinomial theorem:

$$
\frac{15!}{3!2!4!1!5!} = 37837800
$$

What is the probability that an arrangement starts and ends with a red skittle?

Well, suppose we already have a red skittle at the front and the back. Really, what is left is this:

$$
\frac{15!}{3!2!2!1!5!} = 2162160
$$

This is because the 4 red skittles that we used previously in the first part is now 2 red skittles. We can divide this by the sample size to get the probability:

$$
\frac{2162160}{37837800} = 0.057
$$

## Example

An ordinary deck of 52 cards is shuffled and dealt. Take 5 cards at random:

* Let $A$ be the event that all 5 cards are different with respect to their value (no other restrictions), what is $P(A)$?
* Let $B$ be the event of a pair and at most a pair. What is $P(B)$?


For the first part, suppose we choose 5 different _values_ -- this corresponds to:

$$
\Comb{13}{5}
$$

This is because there are 13 values. Now, any of those values can be from any of the 4 suits. So for each value, we multiply by 4 -- or just multiply by $4^{5}$

$$
\Comb{13}{5} * 4^{5} = 1317888
$$

Probability is $\frac{n}{N} = \frac{1317888}{\Comb{52}{5}} = 0.507$

For the second part, we are asked to find the probability of exactly one pair:

This expression gives us the number of sample points of which a pair occurs:

$$
\Comb{13}{1} * \frac{4}{2}
$$


Now, for the remaining, we have to make sure that another pair is not chosen. We choose 3 values out of the remaining 12, and for each of the 3 values they can be any of the 4 suits:

$$
\Comb{12}{3} * 4^{3}
$$

With multiplication rule, we just multiply these occurrences together:

$$
\Comb{13}{1} * \frac{4}{2} * \Comb{12}{3} * 4^{3} = 1098240
$$

Probability of this happening

$$
P(B) = \frac{n}{N} = \frac{1098240}{\Comb{52}{5}} 0.4226
$$
