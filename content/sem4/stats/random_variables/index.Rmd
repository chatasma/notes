Random variable -- numerical description of the outcome of an experiment

* X, Y, Z to denote random variables
* x, y, z, to denote respective values

For example:

* X is the number of heads after tossing a fair coin 10 times

Two types of random variables:

* Discrete random variables -- takes finite or countable values
* Continuous random variables -- takes values or an interval
  * I.e. Height, Weight, and Time (0 to 2 meters)


## Discrete Random Variables

For example, tossing a fair coin 4 times. X can be a discrete random variable representing the number of heads

X can be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with probabilities 1/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/4, and 1/16 respectively.

For a probability mass function of a discrete random variable, f(x):

* f(x) >= 0
* only finite or countable x's
* sum of x's is 1
* P(X = x) = f(x)

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is like PMF, except instead of P(X = x), it is P(X <= x). So you just add the probabilities up, hence it is cumulative.

Expected value

$$
\mu = E(X) = \sum_{x} x f(x)
$$

Where:

* $f(x)$ is the PMF function

## Variance

$$
\sigma^{2} = \text{var}(x) = E[ ( x - \mu )^{2} ] = E(x^{2}) - (E(x))^{2} = E(x^{2}) - \mu^{2}
$$

Where $a$ is a constant:

$$
\sigma^{2}(ax) = a^{2} \sigma^{2}(x)
$$

If $x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{n}$ are independent discrete random variables:

$$
var(x_{1} + x_{2} + ... + x_{n}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} var(xi)
$$

Standard Deviation

$$
\sigma = std(x) = \sqrt{var(x)}
$$

## Special Discrete Random Variables

* Bernoulli Trial: A random experiment with outcomes that are either success or failure, the chance of a success being $p$
* Benoulli Random Variable: A discrete random variable that takes on 1 as success or 0 as failure

Where $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable:

$$
E(X) = p
$$

$$
\sigma^{2}(X) = p (1-p)
$$

* Binomial Trial: Repeat Bernoulli trials independently $n$ times, where the probability of each success is $p$.
* Binomial RV: Number of successes of a binomial trial

PMF, where $n$ is number of trials, and $x$ is the number of successes:

$$
\Comb{n}{x} p^{x} (1 - p)^{n - x}
$$

* x is 0..n

If $X$ is a Binomial RV:

$$
E(X) = np
$$

$$
\sigma^{2} (X) = np (1 - p)
$$
