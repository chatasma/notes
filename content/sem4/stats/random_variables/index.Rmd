Random variable -- numerical description of the outcome of an experiment

* X, Y, Z to denote random variables
* x, y, z, to denote respective values

For example:

* X is the number of heads after tossing a fair coin 10 times

Two types of random variables:

* Discrete random variables -- takes finite or countable values
* Continuous random variables -- takes values or an interval
  * I.e. Height, Weight, and Time (0 to 2 meters)


## Discrete Random Variables

For example, tossing a fair coin 4 times. X can be a discrete random variable representing the number of heads

X can be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with probabilities 1/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/4, and 1/16 respectively.

For a probability mass function of a discrete random variable, f(x):

* f(x) >= 0
* only finite or countable x's
* sum of x's is 1
* P(X = x) = f(x)

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is like PMF, except instead of P(X = x), it is P(X <= x). So you just add the probabilities up, hence it is cumulative.
