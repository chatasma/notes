* Statistics: Data
  * Collect
  * Organize
  * Analyze
  * Interpret
* Population: An entire group of individuals that we want information about
* Sample: A part of the population
* Stastical Inference: An estimate or prediction about population based on information obtained in a sample

We can split statistics into two parts:

* Descriptive Statistics
  * Numerical or graphical methods to get the pattern of the dataset
* Inferential Statistics
  * Use the fact about a sample to estimate the population

Data

* Qualitative Data
  * Categorical, cannot be measured
* Quantitative Data
  * Numerical scale

* Frequency - Number of observations (i.e. 2 entries of a subinterval)
* Relative Frequency - Percentage of observations (i.e. 2 entries of a subinterval / 40 total entries)
