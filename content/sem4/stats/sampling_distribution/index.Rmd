* Population: The entire group we want information about
* Sample: A part of the population

Where $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots , X_{n}$ represent $n$ random random variables:

Sample mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i}
$$

Sample variance:

$$
s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} ( X_{i} - \bar{x} )^{2}
$$
