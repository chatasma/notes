## Sampling Distribution

* Population: The entire group we want information about
* Sample: A part of the population

Where $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots , X_{n}$ represent $n$ random random variables:

Sample mean

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i}
$$

Sample variance:

$$
s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} ( X_{i} - \bar{X} )^{2} = \frac{1}{n(n - 1)} [n \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i}^{2} - (\sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i})^{2}]
$$

## Sampling Distribution of Sample Means

$\bar{X}$ is also a normal random variable with mean and variance ($\bar{X} \sim N( \mu , \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n} )$), given that $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots , X_{n} \sim N(\mu , \sigma^{2})$.

## Central Limit Theorem

If $\bar{X}$ is a mean of a random sample of size $n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^{2}$, then limit of the limiting form of the distribution of

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu }{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

as $n \to \infty$, is the standard normal distribution, i.e., $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.

* $\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu$, $\sigma^{2}_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$ regardless of the population distribution and sample size $n$.
* When sample size $n$ is large enough ($n > 30$), $\bar{X} \sim N( \mu , \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n} )$.
* The CLT provides us the shape of the distribution

## Example

> When a batch of a certain chemical product is prepared, the amount of a particular impurity in the batch is a random variable with mean 4.0 g, and standard deviation 1.5 g. If 50 batches are independently prepared, what is the (approximate) probability that the sample average amount of impurity $\bar{X}$ is between 3.5 and 3.8 g?

We know:

* $\mu = 4.0$
* $\sigma = 1.5$

We know that $n = 50 > 30$, so we can apply CLT to this given the large enough sample size.

CLT tells us

* $\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu = 4.0$
* $\sigma^{2}_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$, or $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.5}{\sqrt{50}} = 0.2121$

Recall that $\bar{X}$ is also a _normal_ random variable, of which we know the mean ($\mu_{\bar{X}}$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_{\bar{X}}$) of.

So, we want to find:

$$
P(3.5 \leq \bar{X} \leq 3.8)
$$

We can convert this into the standard normal distribution using $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$:

$$
P(\frac{3.5 - 4}{0.2121} \leq z \leq \frac{3.8 - 4}{0.2121}) = P(-2.36 \leq z \leq -0.94) = P(z \leq -0.94) - P(z \leq -2.36)
$$

We can use the table to find this, which comes out to be $0.1645$, our answer.

## Sampling Distribution of the Difference between Two Means

Suppose we have two _independent_ samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$. $n_{1}$ has mean $\mu_{1}$ and variance $\sigma^{2}_{1}$. $n_{2}$ has mean $\mu_{2}$ and variance $\sigma^{2}_{2}$. The **sampling distribution** of the **differences of means**, $\bar{X_{1}} - \bar{X_{2}}$ is approximately _normally distributed_ with mean and variance given by:

$$
\mu_{\bar{X_{1}} - \bar{X_{2}}} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}
$$

$$
\sigma^{2}_{\bar{X_{1}} - \bar{X_{2}}} = \frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}
$$

Hence,

$$
Z = \frac{(\bar{X_{1}} - \bar{X_{2}}) - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}_{1} / n_{1} + \sigma^{2}_{2} / n_{2}}} \sim N(0, 1)
$$

If both $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are greater than or equal to 30, the normal approximation for the distribution of $\bar{X_{1}} - \bar{X_{2}}$ is _very good_ when the distributions are not too far away from normal.

## Distribution of Sample Variance

For Chi Squared distribution:

* Consider $X_{1} \sim X^{2} (V_{1}), X_{2} \sim X^{2} (V_{2}), \dots , X_{n} \sim X^{2} (V_{n})$
  * Then, $X_{1} + X_{2} + \dots + X_{n} \sim X^{2} (V_{1} + V_{2} + \dots + V_{n})$
* Consider $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, \dots , Z_{n} \sim N(0, 1)$
  * Then, $Z^{2}_{1} + Z^{2}_{2} + \dots + Z^{2}_{n} \sim X^{2} (n)$

Consider $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots , X_{n}$ i.i.d from a normal distribution.

1. $\bar{X}$ and $s^{2}$ are independent
2. $\frac{(n - 1) s^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} \sim X^{2} (n - 1)$
3. $\mu_{s^{2}} = \sigma^{2}$, $\sigma^{2}_{s^{2}} = \frac{2 \sigma^{4}}{n - 1}$

$s^{2}$ is a good estimate of $\sigma^{2}$.
